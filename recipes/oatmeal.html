    <h1>Making Oatmeal</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rolled oats are quick to cook, but very plain. Their mushy texture can be enhanced with delicious toppings including fruit, nuts, and chocolate. These instructions are for normal rolled oats, not the instant variety that has been shredded and can be prepared with a hot water dispenser.
