# odin-recipes
A useful reference of basic cooking instructions and ingredient ratios. Intended for tired and busy cooks to build off of.

A project made as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

This project is intended to teach introductory HTML structure, and demonstrates skills such as
- images
- absolute and relative links
- ordered and unordered lists
- headings
- paragraphs

This is all review for me, so I am focusing on a few different goals
- atomic git commits
- git branches
- a useful reference for how to cook very simple things when dead tired
- reviewing accessibility standards
